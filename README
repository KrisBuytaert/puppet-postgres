Init the database before you start configuring files as once hba files etc exists in /var/lib/pgsql/data the initial database creation won't work anymore .


include postgres

postgres::initdb{ "host": }


# Current postmaster.ops template has only listen address configurable,  this can offcourse be expanded as needed...


postgres::config{ "host": listen => "*", }
postgres::hba { "host":
                allowedrules => [
                                 "host    DATABASE all    10.0.0.0/32  trust",
                                ],
                }
postgres::enable{ "host": }
